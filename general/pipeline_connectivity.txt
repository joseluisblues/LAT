pipeline connectivity
0. transfer and organize data in the "raw data" folder into the "data_organized” folder > 1_data_organized
- get the csv files, transfer and rename folders
script: mvrenamebiohcapt.bash

1. create the structures from 'summary’ csv files -> bioharness_1
script: createstructurebioh

2. add markers to the structures -> bioharness_2
script: addmarkers.m
markers are in "1_data_markers/danceType”

3. plot the correlation matrices as matrix plots > bioharness_3
> OverallByDance
> Steps1minuteOverlap50s (try1)
script: computematrixcorrelation.m
- needs: variableoverlapcorrelation.m
- needs: plotcorrmatrix.m
:: data is reorganised with relocatefilebioharness.bash

4. plot the correlation matrices as network plots > bioharness_4
> OverallByDance
> Steps1minute (No Overlap) (try2)
script: computematrixcorrelation.m
- needs: variableoverlapcorrelation.m
- needs: plotnetwork.m
:: data is reorganised with relocatefilebioharness.bash

5. (A) calculate the density measures > bioharness_5
> Whole: OverallByDance
> Lags: Steps1minuteOverlap50s (try1)
> All_D: whole periods
script: extractdensity.m
- needs: computedensitySSD.m

5. (B) plot the density measures and compute stats > bioharness_5
script: plotdensity.m

*** another was tried >bioharness_7
> Steps1.75min-nooverlap(105sec)

6. calculate centrality measures > bioharness_6
> Steps1minuteOverlap50sec (try1)
