pipeline HRV
0. transfer and organize data in the "raw data" folder into the "organized data” folder > 1_data_organized
- get the csv files and transfer, rename, correct according to the server files (if necessary and if they exist) and transform to mat files
script: transferingbioharnessfiles_3.m
- needs another script: importECGbioharness.m (import csv in a mat format)

1. create the structures from ECG data (mat files) -> bioharness_1
script: createstructbioh2ecg.m (createstructbioh2ecg_1.m for Oct and Dec)

alternative version make by hand (just removing temporally the file)

2. add markers to the structures -> bioharness_2
script: addmarkers2.m
markers are in 1_data_markers

3. get the IBI series -> bioharness_3
- get the IBI series according to the markers of interest
script: getIBIfromECG.m
- needs another script: getibi.m (which use the ‘findpeaks' function)

3b. visualisation of IBIs series -> bioharness_3 (and a copy in bioharness_3_only_plots)
script: plotIBIs.m

4. HRV analysis with R-HRV -> bioharness_3
- perform HRV analysis and produce mat files for each measure (HRV, HF, LF, HRnoInterp, HRInterp …)
script: HRV_data_processing_5.R (in Documents/R_HRV)

5. generate structures with HRV data -> bioharness_3
script: saveHRVfiles.m

5b. visualisation of HRV data -> bioharness_4
script: plotHRVdata.m

5c. for the tasks compare pre and post
script:	visualizeHRV.m  -> bioharness_5
		visualizeHR.m  -> bioharness_6

6. calculate the mean
script:	computeHRVmean.m -> bioharness_7
		computeHRmean.m -> bioharness_8

7. exclude outliers (M+-2*SD)
		selectgooddata.m ->  bioharness_8
